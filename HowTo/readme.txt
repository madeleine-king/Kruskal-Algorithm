DESCRIPTION: Final project for Smith College course CSC 253: Applied Algorithms in 2022. 

In this project, I implement Kruskal's algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree.

In the course, we built classes for directed and undirected graphs from scratch in Java, which we then used to implement various algorithms. 

To view the graphs we are running the algorithm on, and the outputted minimum spanning trees, open the mathematica notebook External/weightedGraph.nb
